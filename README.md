OpenGL-Project
==============

This is where we will track progress and stay in contact withour code. I recommend going to this site and doing
some of the tutorials -> http://nehe.gamedev.net/
This is where I'll be learning everything from. Now, you have stuff to do and I have stuff to do so we can take our time
working on this. However, I can already promise you that I will be devoting a good amount of time towards this. That being
said, it's understandable if you're not all that interested in studying OpenGL itself and rather just use this as an
opportunity to rehearse good object-oriented programming. If that's the case, that's fine. I'm the one who really needs to
learn the OpenGL anyway. HOWEVER, I guarantee you that by understanding OpenGL, you will both a) be able to understand
practically anything else, and b) be able to contribute a great deal more to this project. As far as what we'll be actually
creating, here is my idea: I want to create a 3D Yu-Gi-Oh! RPG. This isn't necessarily what we have to do, but here is
why I want to do it:

A) Creating the deck system will be a PHENOMENAl method in practicing good object-oriented techniques. It will be
simple and complex at the same time.

B) Being GX themed, the world won't be that big, however, it will be diverse. This gives us the opportunity to try
different OpenGL artistic techniques, such as luminosity, water, depth, etc. Just as a reminder, GX takes place on a
small island. So, we will construct dorms, the academy, a forest, the ocean, and duel monsters.
(For the record, none of this really has to look amazing. We will judge our goal of aesthetic beauty based off of
difficulty and time).

C) Even if there are certain things we don't end up making, any other single thing we make will be awesome experience.
i.e. We choose not to make anything but the academy. We've still constructed a building, duel monsters, and a card system.

D) C'mon. Let's face it. Why would we not try to make this?

Now, again, if there's some reason you would really rather not work on this and you would prefer something else, I am
not stubborn, I've just always wanted to try to make this. And again, just because I'm placing the end goals really high
up there, does not mean that we will or need to reach them all. At the end of the day, I just want a great project to
show off and have had an immeasurable amount of fun doing it.

Your Work Load:
It will be up to you for exactly how much you feel like doing. If you feel as though you have too much stuff and you just
want me to assign you things that I think you could do while I come across them, that's fine. However, if you feel as though
you have a cool idea here and there on something new to do, or even a new way to do something, then I want you to do that
as well. Again, there is no real time limit on this. Work at your leisure. Enjoy the learning and and enjoy the project
itself.
